An Autism diary app:

A 2011 study1 on those with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder found that &quot;Individuals with autism frequently fail to react appropriately to the emotions of others, and researchers have suggested that an impairment in emotional expression recognition may contribute to these inappropriate reactions and to their understanding of emotion in general.&quot;(p.1). From my personal experience and based on the data of the 3 groups in the study, it is my opinion that the reason is not because of a lack of desire or complete cognitive inability. Rather it is the lack of a mental and emotional framework which most people get through the traditional developmental processus. Those with ASD (whether it is because they are high functioning or cognitively impared) are not able to fully participate qualitatively in the traditional social development processus. If they we want to grow, we must develop our own methods and processes in order to find some measure of success.

Basic plot diagram:

Not all your world-building happens here, but this is where you show your readers what “normal” is for your characters. That way, readers will know what’s wrong when we hit the next step.
Rising action, which reveals the conflict. You know that quote about getting your characters up a tree, then throwing rocks at them? This is rock-throwing time. Here’s where you raise the stakes and begin building up to the story’s climax. It’s crucial that your readers know what’s at stake here; it’s also critical that they clearly understand the conflict.
The climax, or turning point. You’ve been building up to this moment all story long. This is the moment that matters most, the moment a character’s choice determines the outcome of the conflict. The big conflict must be addressed here. If you did it right, this is the worst (i.e. best) moment of tension in the whole story, setting your readers on edge, which means now it’s time for . . .
Falling action. It’s time to wind everything down, nice and easy. Here’s where you address all the other problems and questions you’ve brought up, filling in the holes. More importantly, this is also where you explore the results of your characters’ decisions. Think consequences, folks; every choice your characters made have had an effect, and however they resolved the conflict, here’s where we see what happened after.
Resolution. Now, in the resolution, you’re establishing “normal” all over again—but the new normal, incorporating the changes and experiences of your characters. Your readers can sit with your characters a little in their new normal, emotionally wrapping everything up so your reader can put the book away without flipping back through the pages to see what they missed. It’s a scene-closure with enough finality to deserve those two words: The End.
